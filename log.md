# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 23, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Decided to rebuild portfolio page to make it look more professional. Created a Nav bar and content for about me section.

**Thoughts:** I'm happy with the Nav bar, but not the content in About me section. Frustrated with CSS.

**Link to work:** To be provided.
