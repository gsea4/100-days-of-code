# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 23, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Decided to rebuild portfolio page to make it look more professional. Created a Nav bar and content for about me section.

**Thoughts:** I'm happy with the Nav bar, but not the content in About me section. Frustrated with CSS.

### Day 2: July 24, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Finished the layout for my portfolio. Will go shoot some pictures for background and others. And successfully get school database homework to work on the web server.

**Thoughts:** Spent quite a long time on database homework from school but happy that it's working. Right now I'm having 3 different pages for 3 different sections of my portfolio. Will need to research on how to make cool transition between pages.
