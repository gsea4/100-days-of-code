# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 23, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Decided to rebuild portfolio page to make it look more professional. Created a Nav bar and content for about me section.

**Thoughts:** I'm happy with the Nav bar, but not the content in About me section. Frustrated with CSS.

**Today's Progress**: Finished the layout for my portfolio. Will go shoot some pictures for background and others. And successfully get school database homework to work on the web server.

**Thoughts:** Spent quite a long time on database homework from school but happy that it's working. Right now I'm having 3 different pages for 3 different sections of my portfolio. Will need to research on how to make cool transition between pages.

### Day 6: July 28, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: D6 #100DaysOfCode Couldn't do much today on my portfolio. Added a contact page. PHP/MySQL project due Monday. Made some progress on it today

**Thoughts:** Just added a default Bootstrap form on my contact me page. Will need to customize it later. Made progress on database project. Was frustrated I couldn't get the PHP file to display a list of tables on the webpage at first. Took me like an hour to figure it out, but at least I learned something new and made progress on my project
